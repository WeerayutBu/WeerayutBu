# Hi! 👋 I'm Weerayut Buaphet (วีรยุทธ บัวเพชร)

I’m a Ph.D. student at VISTEC, Thailand, specializing in Natural Language Processing (NLP). My research focuses on Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Representation Learning, particularly for low-resource languages like Thai. I’m passionate about tackling challenges in multilingual and domain-specific NER, few-shot learning, and creating datasets for real-world applications such as finance.

## Key Projects  
- **Thai Nested NER Corpus**  
  Published at ACL 2022  
- **Enhancing Few-shot NER with Large Language Models**  
   (Ongoing)  
- **Bilingual Finance NER Dataset**  
  Cross-lingual dataset for Thai/English (Ongoing)
