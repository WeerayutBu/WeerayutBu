# Hi! 👋 I'm Weerayut Buaphet (วีรยุทธ บัวเพชร)

I’m a Ph.D. student in the Natural Language Processing and Representation Learning Lab (NRL) at VISTEC, Thailand, supervised by Associate Professor Prof. Dr. Sarana Nutanong and co-advised by Associate Professor. Prof. Dr. Attapol Rutherford.

PhD Thesis: Resource-Constrained Named Entity Recognition — Contributed a Thai-language dataset for fine-grained nested NER and a bilingual financial NER dataset for the stock market; analyzed the generalization of encoder-based and LLM-based NER models to unseen entity types and new domains; and addressed multilingual text normalization challenges in informal language.

Currently, I am focused on developing and evaluating an LLM-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system for the medical domain, using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning methods (e.g., DPO, GRPO) to train models for multi-turn medical question answering.

## Key Projects  
- **Thai Nested NER Corpus** (Published in ACL 2022)
- **LLM-Augmented Prototype Representation for Few-shot Named-Entity Recognition** (Published in IEEE Access)
- **MultiLexNorm++: A Unified Benchmark and a Generative Model for Lexical Normalization for Asian Languages** (Accepted in TALLIP)
- **Bilingual Finance NER Dataset**: Cross-lingual dataset for Thai/English (Ongoing)
